    "Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a regression technique that performs both regularization and variable selection. It is similar to Ridge Regression, but with a different penalty term. Lasso Regression is widely used in machine learning and statistics for its ability to handle high-dimensional datasets and perform feature selection."

    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter (lambda). Higher values of lambda result in more shrinkage of the coefficients, leading to a sparser model with smaller coefficients. This helps control model complexity and can reduce overfitting. Lower values of lambda allow more predictors to contribute to the model. The optimal lambda value balances the trade-off between model complexity and performance, and it is typically selected using techniques like cross-validation or information criteria."

However, it can be adapted for non-linear regression problems by using feature engineering techniques such as polynomial features, interaction terms, basis functions, and non-linear transformations.

However, for complex non-linear relationships, dedicated non-linear regression techniques may be more appropriate."

It automatically selects one predictor from a group of highly correlated predictors and sets the coefficients of the remaining predictors to zero. This reduces the impact of correlated predictors on the response variable and helps prevent overfitting. However, severe multicollinearity may still pose challenges for accurate coefficient estimation. Other techniques like Ridge Regression or dimensionality reduction methods may be more suitable in such cases."
