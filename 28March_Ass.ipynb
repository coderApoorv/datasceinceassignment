    "Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that incorporates a regularization term to address the issue of multicollinearity and improve model performance. It is an extension of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.\n",

    "In ordinary least squares regression, the goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the predicted values and the actual values. However, in situations where there is high correlation or multicollinearity among the predictor variables, the OLS estimates can become unstable or exhibit high variability.\n",

    "Ridge regression differs from ordinary least squares regression by including a regularization term that shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero, addressing multicollinearity and improving model stability. It provides a trade-off between bias and variance and is particularly useful when dealing with correlated predictors."
