    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: While sensitivity to outliers can be an advantage in some cases, it can also be a drawback. RMSE and MSE can be heavily influenced by outliers, as squaring the errors amplifies their impact. MAE is less sensitive to outliers, but still considers the magnitude of the errors without considering their direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Scale Interpretation: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are scale-dependent metrics, meaning their values depend on the units of the dependent variable. This makes it difficult to compare the performance of models across different datasets or when the scales of the dependent variable change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different Optimization Goals: RMSE, MSE, and MAE have different optimization goals. Minimizing RMSE or MSE corresponds to maximizing R-squared, whereas minimizing MAE corresponds to minimizing the mean absolute deviation. Depending on the specific problem and context, the choice of metric may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring Error Distribution: RMSE, MSE, and MAE provide overall measures of error without considering the distribution of errors. They treat all errors equally, regardless of their direction or shape. This can limit their ability to capture specific characteristics or patterns in the errors."
